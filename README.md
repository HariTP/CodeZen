# CodeZen

CodeZen is a platform for solving Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems. It provides a user-friendly interface for users to create an account, log in, and solve problems.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Users can create an account and log in securely.
- **Problem Solving**: Users can solve DSA problems with an interactive code editor.
- **Problem Categories**: Categorize DSA problems based on their difficulty level or topic (e.g., arrays, strings, linked lists) to help users easily find problems they want to solve.
- **Bookmarking**: Allow users to bookmark problems they find interesting or want to revisit later for solving, making it easier for them to track their progress.
